# Breast-Cancer-Detection-with-ImageMaskNet-CNN

## Dataset Description

### Overview
The Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset forms the cornerstone of our deep learning project, which focuses on the classification of breast ultrasound images into three distinct categories: normal, benign, and malignant. This dataset is instrumental in training and validating the ImageMaskNet, our custom CNN architecture, designed specifically for early breast cancer detection.

### Composition and Source
The dataset comprises 780 ultrasound images, systematically collected from 600 female patients, ranging in age from 25 to 75 years. The data was gathered in 2018 with the primary objective of facilitating breast cancer research. Each image in the dataset maintains an average size of 500x500 pixels and is presented in PNG format, ensuring high-quality and consistency for computational analysis.

### Categories
The dataset categorizes images into three groups, each representing a different breast tissue condition:

- **Normal:** Images classified under this category depict healthy breast tissue, exhibiting no signs of tumors or other abnormalities.

- **Benign:** This category includes images showing non-cancerous tumors. Although these tumors are not immediately life-threatening, they require medical observation and are critical in understanding tumor development.

- **Malignant:** Images in this category indicate the presence of cancerous growths, highlighting cases that necessitate urgent medical attention.

### Significance
The dataset's diversity and comprehensiveness enable the effective training of deep learning models. It provides a realistic representation of various breast tissue conditions, facilitating the development of an AI system capable of distinguishing between normal, benign, and malignant states with high accuracy. The usage of this dataset in our project exemplifies the integration of machine learning in medical diagnostics, potentially revolutionizing the early detection and treatment of breast cancer.
